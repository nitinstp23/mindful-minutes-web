# PROJECT PLAN: Add Clerk Authentication Integration

## Project Overview
Add Clerk authentication to the existing Mindful Minutes meditation app landing page to enable user sign-in/sign-up functionality.

## Analysis
- Current app uses Next.js 15.3.3 with App Router
- Has complete landing page with login/signup buttons (currently non-functional)
- No authentication currently implemented
- Needs Clerk integration following current best practices

## Todo Items
- [x] Install @clerk/nextjs package
- [x] Set up environment variables (.env.local)
- [x] Create middleware.ts with clerkMiddleware
- [x] Update app/layout.tsx to include ClerkProvider and auth components
- [x] Test the integration
- [x] Run typecheck to ensure no type errors

## Implementation Approach
- Follow official Clerk Next.js App Router quickstart
- Use clerkMiddleware() (not deprecated authMiddleware)
- Integrate authentication UI components in layout
- Keep changes minimal and focused

## Review

### Summary of Changes
✅ **Clerk Authentication Successfully Integrated**

Successfully added Clerk authentication to the Mindful Minutes app with the following changes:

1. **Installed @clerk/nextjs v6.22.0** - Latest Clerk SDK for Next.js
2. **Environment Variables** - Created `.env.local` with Clerk keys for authentication
3. **Middleware Setup** - Created `middleware.ts` with `clerkMiddleware()` following current best practices
4. **Layout Integration** - Updated `app/layout.tsx` to include:
   - `ClerkProvider` wrapper for the entire app
   - Fixed header with Sign In/Sign Up buttons when signed out
   - `UserButton` component when signed in
   - Modal-based authentication flow
   - Consistent styling with existing emerald theme

### Technical Implementation
- **Next.js App Router** compatibility with proper middleware configuration
- **TypeScript** type safety with no compilation errors
- **Tailwind CSS** styling integration matching existing design system
- **Modal Authentication** - cleaner UX without page redirects
- **Responsive Header** - fixed positioning for consistent access

### Testing Results
- ✅ Development server starts successfully (Ready in 926ms)
- ✅ Middleware compiles without errors (173ms)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes with no errors
- ✅ Environment variables loaded correctly
- ✅ Authentication UI components render properly

The Clerk integration is complete and ready for users to sign up/sign in. The authentication flow is seamlessly integrated with the existing landing page design.

# PROJECT PLAN: Update Font to Proxima Nova

## Project Overview
Update the application font from Geist Sans to Proxima Nova to improve the design aesthetic.

## Analysis
- Current app uses Geist Sans and Geist Mono fonts from Google Fonts
- Font setup is in `src/app/layout.tsx` using Next.js Google Fonts
- Global styles are in `src/app/globals.css`
- Need to check if Proxima Nova is available via Google Fonts or requires external source

## Todo Items
- [x] Research Proxima Nova availability (Google Fonts vs external source)
- [x] Update font imports in layout.tsx
- [x] Update CSS variables and font-family declarations
- [x] Test the font changes across the app
- [x] Run typecheck to ensure no issues

## Implementation Strategy
Keep changes minimal and focused only on font replacement. Will preserve existing font structure but replace Geist Sans with Proxima Nova.

## Review

### Summary of Changes
✅ **Font Successfully Updated to Montserrat (Proxima Nova Alternative)**

Successfully updated the application font from Geist Sans to Montserrat, which is the closest Google Fonts alternative to Proxima Nova:

1. **Font Research** - Identified Montserrat as the best Google Fonts alternative to Proxima Nova
2. **Layout Updates** - Updated `src/app/layout.tsx`:
   - Changed import from `Geist` to `Montserrat`
   - Updated font variable from `--font-geist-sans` to `--font-montserrat` 
   - Updated className to use new font variable
3. **CSS Variable Updates** - Updated `src/app/globals.css`:
   - Changed `--font-sans` to use `var(--font-montserrat)`
   - Updated body font-family to use the CSS variable
4. **Code Cleanup** - Removed unused `UserButton` import from page.tsx

### Technical Implementation
- **Montserrat Font** - Clean, geometric sans-serif similar to Proxima Nova
- **Next.js Google Fonts** - Proper integration with automatic optimization
- **CSS Variables** - Maintained existing font structure for consistency
- **Build Success** - No compilation errors, builds successfully (152 kB First Load JS)
- **TypeScript** - No type errors, passes typecheck

### Testing Results
- ✅ Build completed successfully with no errors
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes with no issues
- ✅ Font loads properly via Google Fonts
- ✅ All existing styles maintained with new font family

The font update is complete and the application now uses Montserrat as a high-quality alternative to Proxima Nova.
